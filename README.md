# Dev-Pad

DevPad is an idea journalling web application where devs can jot down their tech related ideas. It's a practice project, leveraging CRUD operations. [Work is in progress...]

I have used python's built in sqlite3 for the database. For now there is just one table - 'posts' which contains all the posts. 

Currently working on the front end.
I will implement SQLAlchemy, the database ORM soon.
